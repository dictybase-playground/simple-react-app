# React + Redux App

The initial [project](https://github.com/dictybase-playground/simple-react-app)
created with [cra](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is
converted into a [redux](http://redux.js.org/) application.

## Learning redux
Here are some relevant and useful guides for working with redux at [dictyBase](http://dictybase.org).

### Sceencasts

* **[Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com)** — Build a simple photo app that will simplify the core ideas behind Redux, React Router and React.js

### Tutorials
* **[Official async example](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html#async)** — The official example which includes reading from an external async API.
* **[Step by step tutorial](https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial)** - A detail step by step command line based tutorial for grasping the various concept of redux.

For any reference or documentation, always **always** refers to the official
[website](http://redux.js.org) that is always reliable and up to date.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
